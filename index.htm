            <p>Hi my name is Ben I've been studing computer science here at UML while also working part time.
            My passions include video gaming, spending time with freinds, enjoying the outdoors, and learning new skills.</p>

            <h2 id="codingHistory">Coding History</h2>
            <p>The old quote "A jack of all is a master of none, is often better then a master of one" (Citation unknown) has always 
            struck me as a good moto for developing as a person. The reason I have selected to take this course for my senior year
            has to deal with how I have been learning programing. </p>
            <p>I had started with some simple
            Lego Mindstorms back in elementry school and learning to program with the simplifed block based programing later going 
            on to develop full on pathfinding algorithms and motor balancing curves all while working in the simplifed interface.
            Later on in Middle School I would start learning python as one of my first forays into proper coding languages, using it
            mostly to write simple input output text handling scripts and still consider python one of the best tools for quick 
            projects.</p>
            <p>High school saw my first forray into object based languages with Java and also my first introduction to webdesign with
            HTML, CSS and, JavaScript. Infact most of what I used on this page was done with the vauge memories from that time along
            with self learning with exploring various websites I have encountered, and of course using 
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools's</a> documentation for 
            refrencing the paramiters.</p>
